<h2 class="class-subheading">All About Harry Styles</h2>

<hr>
	<p>Harry Edward Styles (born 1 February 1994) is an English singer. Known for his influence in popular culture, showmanship, artistry, and philanthropy, he is regarded as one of the most influential men in music and fashion and a subject of widespread public interest with a vast fanbase. Styles is considered to be among the most successful solo artists who have emerged from a band.

	Styles' musical career began in 2010 as part of One Direction, a boy band formed on the British music competition series The X Factor after each member of the band had been eliminated from the solo contest. They became one of the best-selling boy bands of all time before going on an indefinite hiatus in 2016. Styles released his self-titled debut solo album through Erskine and Columbia Records in 2017. It debuted at number one in the UK and the US and was one of the world's top-ten best-selling albums of the year, while its lead single, "Sign of the Times", topped the UK Singles Chart.</p>

<h2 class="class-subheading">Early Life</h2>

<hr>
	<p>Harry Edward Styles was born on 1 February 1994 in Redditch, Worcestershire, England,the son of pub owner Anne Twist (n√©e Selley) and finance worker Desmond "Des" Styles. When he was a child, he moved with his parents and older sister, Gemma, to the village of Holmes Chapel in Cheshire. His parents divorced when he was seven years old. His mother later married business partner John Cox, although they divorced years later. Through her subsequent marriage in 2013 to Robin Twist, who died of cancer in 2017, Styles gained an older stepbrother named Mike and a stepsister named Amy.

	Styles said he experienced a "great childhood" and always felt supported by his parents. As a child, he sang covers on a karaoke machine he was given by his grandfather, and the first song he recorded was Elvis Presley's "The Girl of My Best Friend". Styles attended the Holmes Chapel Comprehensive School, where he was the lead singer for the band White Eskimo, which won a local Battle of the Bands competition. At the age of 16, he worked part-time at the W. Mandeville Bakery in Holmes Chapel. Styles also worked a paper round in the local village and at a stable caring after horses during his adolescence.</p>
